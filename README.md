## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

While building this project, I refined my skills on using Flexbox to attain the required design. I revisited the concepts of `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis` and designed the project using Mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

While I am getting comfortable using Flexbox, I am planning to learn CSS Grid and apply the knowledge in building future projects. Also, I have built this for mobile and desktop/ laptop but have not introduced any special breakpoint for large screen mobile devices like tablets.

### Useful resources

- [Guide to CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an awesome article to learn Flexbox concepts and visually see how each property is displayed depending on the value set.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is an amazing resource and I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
